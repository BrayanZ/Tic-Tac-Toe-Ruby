Rules
=============
+ Use only one level of indentation per method
+ Don’t use the else keyword
+ Wrap all primitives and strings
+ Use only one dot per line
+ Don’t abbreviate names
+ Keep all entities small ( < 25 lines )
+ Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables
+ Don’t use any getters/setters/properties (attr_readers are allowed when needed)
+ Use first-class collections (wrap collections in a class, do not use arrays directly)
